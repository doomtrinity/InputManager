# InputManager
Simple input manager for Unity.

//================================================================================

This is a simple input manager that allows you to bind input keys to specific actions ( virtual keys ) at runtime - while playing.

To install it, download or clone this repo, and open the root folder ( should be something like 'InputManager-master' ) as a new Unity project. Click 'ok' or 'proceed' if Unity pops up a warning about the version.

This project contains a sample scene ( _scenes/InputTest.unity ) to test and modify key bindings at runtime. This is intended to be used on PC at the moment. It has been developed with Unity 5.3.3, but you should be able to run it on any 5.x version.
